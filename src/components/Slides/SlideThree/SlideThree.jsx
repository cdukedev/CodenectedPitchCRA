              The technology industry is constantly evolving and growing, but
              not everyone has equal access to the resources and opportunities
              to participate in this growth. This disparity affects not only
              individuals but also small businesses and non-profit organizations
              in under-served communities, who struggle to keep up with the
              rapid pace of technological advancements. Meanwhile, students
              interested in pursuing a career in technology face a number of
              challenges, including a lack of experience in real-world tech
              projects and difficulty finding meaningful opportunities to gain
              experience. This, in turn, affects their ability to build a
              desirable resume and to make a positive impact in the world.
